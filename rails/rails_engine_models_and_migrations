Have a rails project holding all models and migrations and share it with many main apps!

Create a rails engine project with --full option
rails plugin new my_engine --full --database=mysql

Edit my_engine.gemspec and set homepage, summary and description specifications.

Add the following code to lib/my_engine/engine.rb.
This will make your migrations accessible from main app!
class Engine < ::Rails::Engine
  initializer :append_migrations do |app|
    unless app.root.to_s.match root.to_s
      config.paths["db/migrate"].expanded.each do |expanded_path|
        app.config.paths["db/migrate"] << expanded_path
      end
    end
  end
end

Generate and upload your gem to a gem hosting (I like Gemfury).

Add the following line to Gemfile main app:
gem 'my_engine', source: 'source_to_uploaded_gem_file'
